*   **Build Tool:** Gradle
*   **Minimum SDK Version:** `minSdkVersion` <<Specify from your app's build.gradle file>>
*   **Target SDK Version:** `targetSdkVersion` <<Specify from your app's build.gradle file>>

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   **Android Studio:** Latest stable version (e.g., Iguana, Hedgehog). Download from [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
*   **Android SDK:** Ensure you have the Android SDK Platform corresponding to the `targetSdkVersion` installed via Android Studio's SDK Manager.
*   **JDK:** Version <<e.g., 17, or as required by your Android Gradle Plugin version>>
*   **Git (Optional):** If cloning from a repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if hosted on Git):**ThemingThe application uses a custom theme Theme.CoinToss defined in app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml. This theme likely inherits from a base Material Components theme.From AndroidManifest.xml:Kotlin    If you downloaded the source as a ZIP, extract it to your desired location.

2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    *   Launch Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open" (or "Open an existing Android Studio project").
    *   Navigate to the root directory of the `CoinToss` project and select it.

### Building and Running

1.  **Gradle Sync:** Android Studio should automatically sync the project. If not, go to **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files**.
2.  **Select Build Variant:** Usually `debug` for development.
3.  **Run the App:**
    *   Connect an Android device (USB debugging enabled) or start an Android Virtual Device (AVD).
    *   Select the target device in Android Studio.
    *   Click the "Run 'app'" button (green play icon) or select **Run > Run 'app'**.

## How to Use

1.  **Launch the App:** Open "CoinToss" from your app drawer. You will first see a brief splash screen.
2.  **Main Screen:** The main screen will typically display an image of a coin or a prompt to toss.
3.  **Toss the Coin:** Tap the "Toss" button (or the coin image, depending on your UI).
4.  **View Result:** The app will display either "Heads" or "Tails".
5.  **Toss Again:** You can tap the button again for another toss.
